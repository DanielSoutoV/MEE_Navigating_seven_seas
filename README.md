This repository includes the data file, the metadata file, and the R script used to run all analyses for the manuscript "Navitaging the seven seas of arthropod collection protocols: Metabarcoding arthropod diversity in a tropical forest"
The dataset is a presence absence matrix generated after filtering metabarcoding reads. Raw read data is stored in the mBRAVE platform under the project code names CYB003 - CYB014 and are available upon request. Metadata file includes individual sample names, trap type, location and season when traps were deployed.
Any questions regarding the script direct them to daniel.souto.v@gmail.com
